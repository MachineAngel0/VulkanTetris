# TETRIS MADE IN VULKAN GRAPHICS API
- - - 

A simple game of tetris I made to learn how to use the Vulkan API. 
Along the way I also added in very simple Immediate Mode UI and Text Rendering. 

I hope that someone can use this as an example, as there aren't many other examples of small vulkan projects on github to use as a learning resource. 

### BUILD:
    -cmake --build build --config Debug
or

    -cmake --build build --config Release
- Alternatively you could go into the cmake-build-debug or cmake-build-release and launch the VulkanTetris.exe 


### HOW TO PLAY:
- A/D or Left/Right Arrow Keys to move the Tetris Piece 
- W or Up Arrow Key to Rotate the Tetris Piece
- Space Bar to force the tetromino to come down


### NOTE: 
-The text will not scale properly if the window is resized
