# TETRIS MADE IN VULKAN GRAPHICS API
- - - 

A simple game of tetris I made to learn how to use the Vulkan API. 
Along the way I also added in very simple Immediate Mode UI and Text Rendering. 

I hope that someone can use this as an example, as there aren't many other examples of small vulkan projects on github to use as a learning resource.
